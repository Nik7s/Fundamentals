# Github

## Git clone
- Create the repository on GitHub first.
- Use "git clone (github url)" when you want to clone a github repository into a local folder.

## Git status
- Make sure to be in the directory and to save your files first.
- Use "git status" to check if there have been any changes to files that were not added, committed, then pushed to the origin yet.

## Git add .
First step:
- Use "git add ." to add all of the changes made to any files. Only do this for files that you just created, not modified.

## Git commit -m " " -m " "
Second step:
- Use git commit -m "(message)" -m "(message) " to commit the add you did in step one.
- If you already created the file then you can type git commit -am " " to do step 1 and step 2 together.

## Git push
Third step:
- Use "git push" to push the commits to the origin.
- Press "cancel" then sign in to github with your username and password.

## Git pull
- Use "git pull" to pull any changes made in the origin to your local files.

## Git branching
- Branching is good to learn when working with others. It creates temporary repositorites to do some code in that will eventually be merged it into the main repository.
- Type "git branch" to list all branches
- - To create a new branch, type "git checkout -b (name)"
- Type "git checkout (branch)" to change between branches. For the (branch), you can just type the first letters and TAB to finish.
- "git diff" shows you what has been changed
- "git merge (branch)" merges the branches and pushes the changes
- "git branch -d (branch)" deletes the branch

## Undoing git
- "git reset" will undo any adds that you have.
- "git reset (file)" will undo any changes from the file you just made changes to.
- "git reset HEAD~1"  will undo the last commit
- "git log" gives a list of all previous commits. You can find the hash of a commit to paste into "git reset (hash)", which undos a specific commit.
- "git reset --hard (hash)" will completely remove all the changes in this specific commit.
